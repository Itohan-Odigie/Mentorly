## Inspiration
While researching for this Hackathon, we stumbled across a study on Psychology Today, which found that non-parental mentoring **significantly** affects positive youth development. After further diving into this issue, we were shocked to find that teen girls and non-binary individuals had considerablyly harder time managing stress than boys, partly because of a **lack of steady role models**. Mentorly was our solution to that gap, providing mentors not just for career advice but for puberty support, sexuality crises, and home-life trouble. 

## What it does
Mentorly is a web app/friendly mentor finder designed to help you find a role model that suits **your** interests. Within the website, you can journal to mark down thoughts you want to share with your mentor, join fun online events, seek advice on a forum and meet new people.

## How we built it
We built Mentorly using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. We designated certain pages to groups while maintaining consistency through constant Discord check-ins.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges integrating the Event page, as each of our monitors were different sizes, but eventually, we were able to adjust it. Another problem we faced was blending the login page; we soon found out it was a typo regarding the file login.html. Lastly, one major problem we faced was the nav bar which refused to be sticky; we solved this with some advice by changing the z-index.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are all proud to have completed a full website within time constraints. We also are proud to have successfully pitched, edited, and scripted a video. This is the first time all of us have participated in a hackathon, so we are all incredibly proud of our web app.

## What we learned
We learned how to push files onto Github, some new CSS animations, and how to create a functional login page.

## What's next for Mentorly
In the future, we hope to expand our site to include more events, mood trackers, and maybe even real-life mentors and mentees!
